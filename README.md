# python-requirements-maker
**Extract, Install and Creates** packages requirements.txt file from any python file - it reads the "import"s and "from"s.

SAVES A LOT OF TIME AND FRUSTRATION installing or testing new projects and repos!!!

1. Activate the python environment
2. Paste the file in the python file folder  
3. **python parserR.py** 'main.py'

This will make the file parse the required packages from the file.
